# Real-Time Eye Tracking Using Heat Maps

This repository contains the **official code implementation** of our paper:

**[Real-Time Eye Tracking Using Heat Maps](https://ejournal.um.edu.my/index.php/MJCS/article/view/35825)**  
📄 *Published in Malaysian Journal of Computer Science, 2024*

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time, instant eye tracking using webcam input
- Implements a **9-point calibration system** for increased accuracy
- Tracks eye gaze and maps it to screen coordinates using heat map visualization
- Outperforms GazeRecorder-based solutions in both speed and precision
- Accuracy is **2× higher** than conventional webcam-based eye tracking tools
- Suitable for interactive experiments, accessibility research, and visual attention studies

## ▶️ How to Run

This project is entirely built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, making it easy to run locally without any installation.

### 🔧 Steps

1. **Clone or download** the repository to your local machine
2. Open the main HTML file (e.g., `index.html`) in your **preferred web browser**
3. The real-time eye tracking interface should launch automatically if a webcam is available

> 🛑 **Note:**  
> Some proprietary components (e.g., calibration logic, smoothing filters, or mapping algorithms) are **not included** in this public release. These can be **provided upon request** for academic or non-commercial use.

### 🔌 Integration

You can also integrate these modules with your **custom eye tracking software**, especially if:
- You're building browser-based gaze-tracking experiments
- You want to visualize gaze data in real time
- You need a lightweight, calibration-based solution

> 📬 Contact us or open an issue if you'd like help with integration or access to missing modules.

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

Special thanks to the team behind **[WebGazer.js](https://webgazer.cs.brown.edu/)** — an open-source, browser-based eye tracking library.  
Parts of this project were adapted from their work to enable real-time tracking and calibration via the browser.

> WebGazer provided a strong foundation for integrating webcam input and gaze estimation using only frontend technologies.
